Repo Created on 01/12/2021 by Matt Mosier

Purpose: "textgen" web tool was initially created by Matt Mosier at the Storm Prediction Center to assist in the quick generation of text for Mesoscale Discussions. It has recently been updated to include more information including conditional probabilities as well as IBW recommendations.

	This update cleans up some of the development files and simplifies the repo. The "index.html" file should have the latest version of the tool.
